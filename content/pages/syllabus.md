--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Labs: 2 sessions / week, 2 hours / session

Description
-----------

This course offers an introduction to quantitative analysis of geomorphic processes, and examines the interaction of climate, tectonics, and surface processes in the sculpting of Earth's surface. Topics include:

*   Quantitative introduction to mechanics of fluvial, hillslope, and glacial processes.
*   Essentials of weathering, soil formation, runoff, erosion, slope stability, sediment transport, river morphology, and glacial erosion.
*   System responses to climatic and tectonic forcings, including: glaciation, sea level change, uplift, subsidence, and post-glacial isostatic rebound.

The course stresses field investigation of geomorphic phenomena and the writing of scientific reports. Additional instruction in: computer modeling (MATLABÂ®) in the study of surface processes, image analysis, and GIS analysis of digital elevation data.

Format and Level
----------------

This course is taught at an advanced level, but open to undergraduates (Junior/Senior level is recommended) as well as graduate students. Expectations will differ for undergraduates. This course meets with graduate subject 12.463, but assignments differ.

Labs and Field Trips
--------------------

There are 5 labs including a field trip to Mt. Washington, New Hampshire and 2 field trips to Baker River, New Hampshire.

Grades
------

Reports from labs and field trips will be the basis for evaluation for grades in this course.
