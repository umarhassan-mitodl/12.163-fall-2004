description: In this lab the student will learn to work with Matlab and use a simple
  numerical model to explore geological and climatic controls on hillslope forms.
  The student will use a Matlab script ("hillslope_profile3.m") for modeling hillslope
  evolution under imposed sets of processes and boundary conditions (these are the
  geological and climatic conditions).
